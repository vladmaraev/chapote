** Explainability: active and passive
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- passive :: developer or researcher analyses and interprets system's
  internal state (cf. "Explainable AI")
- active :: let the system *speak* for itself, and explain its own
  choices
\pause
*** 
We need to explore how humans do it in real interactions 
** What we did?
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- We based our approach to reasoning on the notions of *enthymemes* and
  *topoi*.
- We extended our own proof-theoretic dialogue management framework
  with support for *active explainability*.

*  Reasoning in dialogue
** Artificial agents fail

** How people interactively reason in natural dialogue?
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- it involves "non-logical" common sense reasoning
- *enthymeme*, "rhetorical syllogism", conclusion doesn't follow by necessity
- enthymeme is negotiable and cancellable
** Topoi
*Dave:  How can you play football and not go to school then?*

#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- Dave's utterance is underpinned by the general principle -- *topos* (pl. *topoi*).
- discussed in connection with rhetoric and argumentation[fn::fullcite:toulmin2003]
- part of linguistic meaning and discourse cohesion[fn::fullcite:ducrot1988]

* Linear logic
** Linear logic
- hypotheses may be used only once: 
  #+BEGIN_code
  IsAt x Valand y ⊸ 
    IsAt x CentralStationen (y+45 min)
  #+END_code

- unrestricted implication (|->|) still remains, for immutable facts
  #+BEGIN_code
  Hungry Vlad -> Eat Vlad IceCream ⊸ 
    Happy Vlad
  #+END_code

To our knowledge citet:dixon2009plans were the first to advocate the
use of linear logic for dialogue management and planning (but no
domain-generality and ISU).

*  Dialogue management (DM)

*  Enthymematic reasoning in DM

*  Discussion / conclusions

** Explainability: active vs passive
- It is social: we are 30 times more likely to laugh in presence of others.
- Kids laugh before they learn to speak; laughter can be informative
  about their development.[fn::Provine, R. R. (2004). Laughing, tickling, and the evolution of speech and self. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13(6):215–218]
